# EURASIA's INTENTIONS EXPOSED

Eurasia’s forces, rather than engaging in honorable conflict, continue to target vulnerable populations in a desperate attempt to destabilize our progress. Their actions are intended to spread fear and suffering, but the resilience of Oceania remains unbroken. Citizens who have witnessed Eurasia’s behavior describe a pattern of intimidation and cruelty that speaks to their regime’s moral bankruptcy.

The Ministry of Peace has condemned these transgressions, reaffirming that Oceania’s mission is one of justice and liberation. “Eurasia’s methods are designed to sow chaos,” a Party spokesperson stated, “but their attempts will be thwarted. Oceania’s strength lies in its unity, its loyalty to Big Brother, and its commitment to truth.”
